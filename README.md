## Home Test ##

Dear candidate,

Thank you for taking the **CannonTrading** home test. Please take your time to read the instructions.

At **CannonTrading** we often need to retrieve data from different sources and make that data available in our APIs.

One of those is the ASX listed companies. The list of companies is available online as a CSV (the URL is in the appsettings). An example CSV file is included in the Docs folder. Also that list is updated once a day.

For this test, we have started a new API project with one endpoint. That endpoint gets an ASX listed company by its ASX code.

The goal is to **make the API work reliably** once released in production.

We would like to see **well-tested quality code that is presentable, resilient, efficient, and foolproof**.

Feel free to add, or change, anything as you see fit.

Please submit your changes as a pull request from your branch.

All the best, and looking forward to see what you come up with!
